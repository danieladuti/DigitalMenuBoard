DigitalMenuBoard is a personal project from 2024-2025, made under the guidance of the Computer Networks course in the second semester of Computer Science Faculty Ia»ôi.

# Requirement 
Develop a system based on client/server architecture for displaying digital menus in restaurants, which can be updated remotely by owners or managers.

# What is the project about?
The project is based on client/server architecture using multiplexing so that we can connect multiple clients to the server and every client can get his response on time. It doesn't have a graphic interface, the communication between client and server is done through the console, in the terminal, because the code was written to be run on a Linux machine.

The client can choose from a menu with multiple choises like : 

1.conectare : username
    
 2.afisare 
 
 3.creeaza meniu 
 
 4.inserare : nume_produs ingredient_1,ingredient_2 pret 
 
 5.modificare : nume_produs atribut produs(ingrediente/pret) 
 
 6.stergere : nume_produs 
 
 7.deconectare
